Here are some open-world datasets of EDROD method.

- The wind turbine dataset includes features such as wind speed, generator speed, power, wind direction, etc, which were collected by our research group in the real-world environment. Wind turbines that are not in a normally-working state are considered anomalous samples. 
- The Wave dataset simulates the generation of ocean waves and consists of 40 features for each of the two waveforms. We consider the data of the first wave as normal samples, and select 12 data from the second wave as abnormal samples.

See “https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/annsanababy/waveform-dataset” for the details of the dataset. 

- The Breastw dataset is a classification dataset that records measurement data of breast cancer cases. The dataset consists of two categories, namely benign and malignant. Samples belonging to the malignant category are considered an anomaly, while samples from the benign category are considered normal.

See “https://datahub.io/machine-learning/breast-w” for the details of the dataset.

- The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset collected by the University of Wisconsin Hospital is used to classify tumors as benign or malignant. Benign and malignant are considered normal and abnormal respectively. 

See “http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic” for the details of the dataset.

- The wine dataset is derived from the Wine dataset. This dataset includes features such as alcohol, Malic acid and ash, etc., which are the results of a chemical analysis of wines. In this dataset, there are three types of wine. We consider the data of the first type of wine as normal samples and other types of wine as abnormal samples. 

See “https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine” for the details of the dataset.

- The Letter dataset is derived from the Letter Recognition dataset. The original recognition dataset was designed to identify each of a large number of black-and-white rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the English alphabet. Therefore, in this dataset, three letters are selected as normal samples, while samples of other letters are chosen as outliers.

- The Ionosphere dataset is collected by a radar system in Goose Bay, Labrador. This system consists of a phased array of 16 high-frequency antennas with total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts. The dataset includes 17 pulse numbers for the Goose Bay system. Data with radar echoes are considered normal while data without radar are considered abnormal.

- The Glass dataset consists of nine composition elements in the glass, such as aluminum content, silicon content, calcium content, etc. The dataset also includes annotations indicating the class of each glass, i.e. the glass is normal or abnormal.

See “https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/42/glass+identification” for the details of the dataset.

- The Parkinson dataset is composed of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson disease. The data consists of 22 metrics and 195 data points. The data diagnosed with Parkinson disease is considered as abnormal samples, while those without disease are considered normal samples.
